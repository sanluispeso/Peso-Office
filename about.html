    <h1>History of the Public Employment Service Office (PESO) in the Municipality of San Luis, Aurora</h1>

    <p>
        The establishment and strengthening of the Public Employment Service Office (PESO)
        in the Municipality of San Luis, Aurora is rooted in the national government’s
        commitment to institutionalizing employment facilitation services across local
        government units (LGUs), as mandated by Republic Act No. 10691.
    </p>

    <p>
        Under Section 1 of RA 10691, all provinces, cities, and municipalities are required
        to establish, operate, and maintain a PESO under the Office of the Governor,
        City Mayor, or Municipal Mayor. The law envisions PESO as a frontline service
        office responsible for linking job seekers with employment opportunities,
        supporting workforce development, and promoting livelihood programs at the
        local level.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consistent with this mandate, the Municipality of San Luis, Aurora began organizing
        its local employment facilitation services with the designation of a PESO Manager.
        On February 6, 2024, Hon. Ariel A. De Jesus, Municipal Mayor of San Luis, Aurora,
        formally designated Ms. Joanna Pauline A. Raymundo as PESO Manager. Her appointment
        marked the operational beginning of the municipality’s PESO functions.
    </p>

    <p>
        As PESO Manager, Ms. Raymundo was tasked with facilitating labor market information
        exchange between job seekers and employers, providing employment services for both
        local and overseas work, and assisting employers in recruitment. The office also
        undertook referral services for livelihood and self-employment programs, conducted
        employability enhancement trainings and seminars, offered career guidance and
        counseling, provided pre-employment orientation for overseas workers, developed
        testing and evaluation tools, and extended reintegration assistance to returning
        migrant workers.
    </p>

    <p>
        To further institutionalize employment services within the municipal government,
        the Sangguniang Bayan of San Luis enacted Municipal Ordinance No. 005-2024 during
        its regular session on April 30, 2024. Anchored on the provisions of Republic Act
        No. 7160, or the Local Government Code of 1991, the ordinance formally created the
        position of Senior Labor and Employment Officer (Salary Grade 19).
    </p>

    <p>
        The creation of this position marked a significant milestone in the development
        of the Public Employment Service Office in San Luis, Aurora. What began as a
        designated function evolved into a structured and institutionalized local
        government service, reinforcing the municipality’s role in promoting decent
        employment, economic mobility, and inclusive community development.
